# Running Experiments on GrowthBook

GrowthBook has a few different ways to run experiments or AB tests depending on your needs. This guide will walk you
through the different ways of running experiments on GrowthBook.

## Server Side Experiments

Server-side A/B testing, also known as backend or server-side experimentation, is a technique used in software
development and web applications to test measure the impact of any code changes or new features. The changes may impact
both the user interface and the backend of the application, but the decision about what version to serve a user is
decided on the server. This has a number of advantages over client side experiments, specifically, that it allows you to
run very complex tests that may involve a lot of different parts of the code, and span multiple parts of your
application. It also avoids any issues with flickering that can happen with client side testing.

### Feature Flag Experiments

With GrowthBook, the easiest way to do server-side testing is by using feature flags. Each feature flag has conditional
logic ([rules](/features/rules)) [how, who](/features/targeting) ([and when](/features/scheduling)) a feature should be
shown. With GrowthBook, you can add a rule to a feature that will randomly assign the users based on some attribute into
one of your experiment variations. You can read more about feature flag experiment rules [here](/features/rules).

### Inline Experiments

You can also run server-side experiments by using inline experiments directly with our SDK. This requires no 3rd party
requests, as the experiment conditions and settings can be written directly into the code. How you implement in-line
experiments depends on the SDK language you're using, you can read more about this from our [SDKs pages](/lib).

## Client Side Experiments

Client-side A/B testing, also known as frontend or client-side experimentation, is a way to test visual changes to your
application. The server returns the same code to all users, and the experiment assignments and variations are handled by
the client, typically in [Javascript](/lib/js) or [React](/lib/react).

When the client loads your application, our SDK will check to see if the user should be part of any experiments, and if
so, assign them and the client code will serve that variations treatment to them. GrowthBook's client side SDKs can
handle all of this for you, and you can also serve client-side A/B test via our feature flags, or using our visual editor.

Client-side A/B tests are great for testing visual changes to your application, but they do have some drawbacks. One of
the most common issues is caused by the delay in loading the specific variation to a user, which may cause a flash or
flickering as the experiment loads. This can be reduced by using inline-experiments, or by moving the GrowthBook SDK
code higher in the code so it loads at the same time or before the page. Sometimes the hashing attribute may not be
available until your tracking software has loaded, and you may need to use a custom tracking id.

## Visual Editor (WYSIWYG) Experiments

GrowthBook has a visual editor for running experiments on the front-end of your website without requiring any code
changes. Our visual editor uses the same client-side SDK used for feature flags and A/B testing.

## How GrowthBook Assigns Users to Experiments

GrowthBook uses a consistent hashing algorithm to assign users to experiments. This means that the same user will always
get the same variation given the same experiment settings (experiment key, and user hashing id). This is useful
because it means that you can run experiments across multiple pages, or even multiple applications, and the user will
always get the same variation. It also means that GrowthBook stores no state, and requires no additional cookies.
